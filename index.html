				<h2>Why is this important?</h2>
				<p> Of 6.3 billion tons of plastic waste, only 9% is recycled. That is about
					 5.7 billion tons of plastic that could be recycled but are thrown away due 
					 to ignorance of knowing what to recycle. If we could create a way for people to
					  be able to easily know whether something is recyclable, we would be able to 
						significantly increase the percentage recycled thus reducing the amount of plastic 
						pollution. This allows us to stop pollution at its roots  before it happens.
